# Add Filters to our Movies App

# Challenge Description
In this challenge, we want to add filters to the UI so users can look for specific movies by title and year of release.

## Requirements
- Capture user input in the form using some of the tools described in our lesson.
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Is this a complex form or a simple one? What's the easiest approach to get a form's value?
- Use the `filterMovieList` from `movies.service` to get an Observable of filtered movies based on user input.
- Display a filtered list of movies to the user.

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
